The program must accept N integers as the input. For every three integers among
the given N integers, the program must print the largest possible three-digit integer
using their unit digits. If it is not possible to form a three-digit integer, then the
program must print -1 as the output.

Note: The value of N is always a multiple of 3.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <=N <=999
0 <= Each integer value <= 1048

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains N/3 integer values separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:

6

988 54 19 87 64 25

Output:
984 754

Explanation:

The largest three-digit integer formed using the unit digits of 988 54 19 is 984.
The largest three-digit integer formed using the unit digits of 87 64 25 is 754.
Hence the output is

984 754

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:

9

2 50 18 590 10 890 87 68 18

Output:
820 -1 887
