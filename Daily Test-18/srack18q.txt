The program must accept N space-separated string values as the input. The program
must print the count of common words in the N string values as the output. If a word
has occurred more than once in all the N string values then the program must
consider the count as 1 for that common word.

Note: The N string values are case sensitive.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <=N <= 100
3 <= Length of each string value <= 1000
1 <= Length of each word <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each containing a string value.

Output Format:
The first line contains the count of common words in the N string values.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
3
hi hello world
hi how are you world
say hi to the world

Output:
2

Explanation:
The common words in the 3 string values are hi and world, so the count of common
words is 2.

Hence the output is 2
