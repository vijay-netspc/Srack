The program must accept N string values containing only alphabets as the input. The program
must sort the string values based on the count of lower case alphabets. If two ore more string
values have the same count of lower case alphabets, then the program must print those string
values based on their order of occurrence as the output. Finally, the program must print the
sorted string values as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):

2<=N<=50
1 <= Length of each string <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The next N lines, each contains a string value.

Output Format:
The first N lines, each contains a string value based on the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
3
candY
faNcY
mObile

Output:
faNcY
candY
mObile

Explanation:
The count of lower case alphabets in candY is 4.
The count of lower case alphabets in faNcY is 3.
The count of lower case alphabets in mObile is 5.
After sorting the string values based on the count of lower case alphabets, the string values become

faNcY
candY
mObile
