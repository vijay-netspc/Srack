The program must accept a time T in 24-hr format (HH:MMSSS) as the input. The program
must print the binary clock representation for the given time T.

The following five lines represent the format of the Binary Clock.

HH:MM:SS
#- #- #-
#- -- --
-- -- --
-- -- --

The hyphens in each column (from top to bottom) of the binary clock represent the binary
representation of the corresponding digit in the given time (HH:MM:SS). The hash symbols (#)
in the binary clock represent the empty cells.

Boundary Condition(s):
0 <= HH <= 23
0 <= MM <=59
0 <=SS <= 59

Input Format:
The first line contains the time T in 24-hr format (HH:MM:SS).

Output Format:
The first five lines contain the binary clock representation of the given time T.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12:35:49

Output:
HH:MM:SS
#0 #0 #1
#0 01 10
01 10 00
10 11 01

Explanation:

The given time T is 12:35:49.

The 1st column represents the digit 1. So the hyphens in the 1st column are replaced with the
binary representation of 1 (##01).
The 2nd column represents the digit 2. So the hyphens in the 2nd column are replaced with the
binary representation of 2 (0010).
The 3rd column represents the digit 3. So the hyphens in the 3rd column are replaced with the
binary representation of 3 (#011).
The 4th column represents the digit 5. So the hyphens in the 4th column are replaced with the
binary representation of 5 (0101).
The 5th column represents the digit 4. So the hyphens in the 5th column are replaced with the
binary representation of 4 (#100).
The 6th column represents the digit 9. So the hyphens in the 6th column are replaced with the
binary representation of 9 (1001).

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
00:15:59

Output:
HH:MM:SS
#0 #0 #1
#0 01 10
00 00 00
00 11 11
