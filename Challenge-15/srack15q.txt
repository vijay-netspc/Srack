The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must find all possible pairs of integers whose sum is present in the given N integers. 
Then the program must sort the pairs based on the sum. If two or more pairs having the same sum, then the program must sort those pairs based on the value of the first operand.
Finally, the program must print the sorted pairs based on the following format. Operand1 + Operand2 = Sum
If there is no such pair, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 50 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The lines, each contains two operands and their sum or the first line contains -1.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
4
2 1 3 5

Output:
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 1 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 2 = 5
