The program must accept a string S (encrypted string) containing digits and asterisks as the input. The encryption algorithm is given below:

The alphabets from a to j are replaced with the digits from 0 to 9 respectively.
The alphabets from k to z are replaced with the values from 10* to 25* respectively.
The program must decrypt the string S and print it as the output.

Note: The string S is always a valid encrypted string.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains the encrypted string S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the decrypted string S.

Example Input 1:
18*10*811*11*17*0210*

Output:
skillrack
