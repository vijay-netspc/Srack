The program must accept two integers R and C representing the size RxC of a grid of lamps as the 
input. Initially, all the lamps turned OFF (0) in the grid. The program also accepts Q queries, where 
each query contains two integers representing the position of a lamp to be turned ON (1). For each query,
the lamp present in the specified position will be turned ON and all other lamps present in the same row, 
column will be toggled (OFF to ON or ON to OFF). Finally, the program must print the status of RxC grid of
lamps after processing Q queries as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Q <= 20

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The second line contains Q.
The next Q lines, each contains two integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers representing the status of RxC grid of lamps.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:

1 2
4 3
1 5

Output:
0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 0 1
