The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as the input. The program 
must sort the 2x2 submatrices in the matrix based on the integer present in the 
top-left position. If two or more submatrices have the same integer value in the top-left position,
then the program must sort those submatrices in the order of their occurrence.
Note: The values of R and C are always even.

Boundary Condition(s):
4 <= R, C <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.
