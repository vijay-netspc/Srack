The program must accept an array of N integers and an integer K as the input. The program
must remove a subarray of size K in the give array so that the sum of the remaining integers in
the array is maximum. Then the program must print the integers that are removed from the
array as the output. If two or more such subarrays are present in the given array, then the
program must remove the first occurring subarray.
Boundary Condition(s):
1<=K<N <=1045
-100 <= Each integer value <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.
Output Format:
The first line contains K integers representing the integers in the subarray which are removed
as per the given conditions.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
7
10 20 5 2 -5 66 -69
3
Output:
-5 66 -69
