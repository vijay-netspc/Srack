A magic candle will always glow, but if someone drops a drop of water 
on the candle it will not light up for the next X seconds and then it will 
start to light up again. The program must accept N sorted integers representing
the time series in which the water drops on the candle and the value of X as the input.
The program must print the total time that the candle is not in the glowing state as the output. 
If a drop of water dropped on the candle when it is not in the glowing state, then the 
candle will start to light up after X seconds 
(i.e., the candle will not consider the previous drop of water).

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 1000 1 <= Each integer value <= 10^8
1 <= x <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space. The third line contains X.

Output Format:
The first line contains the total time that the candle is not in the glowing state.
