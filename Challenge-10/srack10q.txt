The program must accept a list of unique integers as the input. For each integer X
among the given list of integers, the program must print the smallest integer among
the integers greater than X in the given list. If there is no integer greater than X, then
the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Number of integers in the list <= 10*4
1 <= Each integer value <= 10*6

Input Format:
The first line contains the list of integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the list of integers as per the given conditions.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
2 3 11 7 1 3 5

Output:
3 5 -1 8 2 11 7

Explanation:
The integers in the given list are 2 3 11 7 1 8 5.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 2 is 3 (3, 5, 7, 8, 11). So 3 is
printed.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 3 is 5 (5, 7, 8, 11). So 5 is
printed.
There is no integer greater than 11. So -1 is printed.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 7 is 8 (8, 11). So 3 is printed.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 1 is 2 (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11). So 2 is
printed.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 8 is 11. So 11 is printed.
The smallest integer among the integers greater than 5 is 7 (7, 8, 11). So 7 is printed.
