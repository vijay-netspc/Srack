The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must print the length
of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix in S. If there is no common
proper prefix and proper suffix, the program must print -1 as the output.

Note: The proper prefix and proper suffix may overlap in the string S.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 105

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper
suffix in S or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
abcdxyzabcd

Output:
4

Explanation:

The longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix in the string
abcdxyzabcd is abcd.

So the length of the proper prefix or proper suffix is 4.

So 4 is printed as the output.
