The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must find the number of factors M for the integer N.
Then the program form a grid of size MxM and fill the grid based on the following conditions.
- The cells in the first inverted L-shaped layer are filled with the first factor of N.
- The cells in the second inverted L-shaped layer are filled with the second factor of N.
- Similarly, the remaining inverted L-shaped layers of the grid are filled with the remaining factors of N.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first M lines, each contains M integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6

Output:
1 1 1 1
1 2 2 2
1 2 3 3
1 2 3 6

Explanation:
Here N = 6.
The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. So the value of M is 4.
The grid of size 4x4 with the factors of 6 is given below.
1 1 1 1
1 2 2 2
1 2 3 3
1 2 3 6
