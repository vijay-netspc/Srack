The program must accept N integers as the input. For each integer X among the N integers,
the program must shift the smallest digit in X to the right. If the smallest digit occurs 
more than once in an integer, the program must shift the last occurring smallest digit to 
the right. Then the program must print the sum of the N modified integers as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= Each integer value <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of the N modified integers as the output.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
5729 123 7979 1099

Output:
16010

Explanation:
Here N = 4.
After shifting the smallest digit in each integer to the right, the integers become 5792 231 7997 1990.
The sum of the modified integers is 16010.
So 16010 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
7
35 117 808 168 950 5 1541
Output:
4281
