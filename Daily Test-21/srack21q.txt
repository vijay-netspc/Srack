The program must accept three integers N, P, and Q as input. The program must print the number of 
times Q occurs at least once in the sum when P is added to N for P times as the output.

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵  
1 ≤ P, Q ≤ 10⁵

Input Format:

- The first line contains N.
- The second line contains P.
- The third line contains Q.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the number of times Q occurs at least once
in the sum when P is added to N for P times.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:  
15  
5  
5  

Output:  
2

Explanation:

Here, N = 15, P = 5, and Q = 5.

- Initially, the sum is 15, and the count is 0.
- In the 1st iteration, Q = 5 is not present in the sum 20 (15 + 5 = 20). So, the count remains 0.
- In the 2nd iteration, Q = 5 is present in the sum 25 (20 + 5 = 25). So, the count becomes 1.
- In the 3rd iteration, Q = 5 is not present in the sum 30 (25 + 5 = 30). So, the count remains 1.
- In the 4th iteration, Q = 5 is present in the sum 35 (30 + 5 = 35). So, the count becomes 2.
- In the 5th iteration, Q = 5 is not present in the sum 40 (35 + 5 = 40). So, the count remains 2.

Thus, the count 2 is printed as the output.
