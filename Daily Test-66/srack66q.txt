In a spin game, the integers from 0 to 99 are written on the border of a wheel in clockwise
direction. Initially, the top of the wheel indicates the integer K. A boy spins the wheel N times.
For each spin, X integers cross the top position of the wheel either in the clockwise(positive
value) or counterclockwise(negative value) direction. The program must accept N integers
representing the N spins and the value of K as the input. The program must print the integer
present on the top of the wheel after each spin as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <=N <= 1000
0<=K <=99
-1048 <= Each integer value <= 1048

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains N integers separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1: N
