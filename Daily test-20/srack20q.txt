The program must accept a string S$ containing multiple words as the input. The
program must find the words which are repeated more than once in the string S.
Then the program must sort the repeated words in descending order based on the
length. If two or more words have the same length, then the program must sort
those words in the order of their occurrence. If all the words in the string S are
unique, then the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the repeated words based on the given conditions or -1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
when there is a will there is a way

Output:
there is a

Explanation:

In the string “when there is a will there is a way”, the repeated words are there, is
and a.

The length of the word there is 5.

The length of the word is is 2.

The length of the word a is 1.

After sorting the repeated words in descending order based on the length, the words
become
there is a
