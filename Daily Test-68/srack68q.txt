the following series as the output.
5, 14, 19, 23, 28, 32, 37, 41, 46, and so on.
The sum of digits in each term of the above series is divisible by 5.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= K <= 10^5

Input Format:
The first line contains K.

Output Format:
The first line contains the Kth term in the given series.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
4
Output:
23

Explanation: 
The given series is 5, 14, 19, 23, 28, 32, 37, 41, 46, and so on. The 4th term in the series is 23. So 23 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
