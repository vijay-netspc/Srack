The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC and two integers M and N as the input.
The integers M and N represent the position of a cell C in the matrix. 
The program must print the sum of integers which are present in the top-left to bottom- right diagonal having the cell C in the matrix.

Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= R, C <= 50
1 <= Matrix element value <= 1000
1 <= M <= R
1 <= N <= C

Input Format:
The first line contains R and C separated by a space.
The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.
The (R+2)nd line contains M and N separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the sum of integers which are present in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal with the cell C in the matrix.
